I'm happy to announce that I've been promoted to Staff Engineer at Compass.

Eight years ago I joined as a Software Engineer, back when all of the engineers
had their picture on a single webpage. I've been fortunate enough to grow with
the company and in this industry, that's rare.

I'm grateful to the mentors, colleagues, and leaders who've supported my
journey. And I'm excited about what comes next, both for my own growth and for
the problems we'll solve together.

And I'm most grateful to my wife, Lauren. Lauren has been my greatest advocate
and advisor throughout my career. From learning to code on nights and weekends
to building the confidence to lead teams, Lauren has been my rock and a source
of strength throughout my journey. Without her, I would not be where I am
today.

Here's to the next chapter.
