I haven’t written a blog post recently because I recently relocated to Boston! I’ve only been here since July but it has been a fantastic time already. I was prompted to leave because of my Lauren’s new position at Connoly Partners, an advertising company operating out of the South End. I looked online for potential opportunities and found that Third and Grove was offering a position for a Front-end Engineer to work on accounts for major brands. I was sad to leave the team at Xerox, but I couldn’t turn down an adventure to the East Coast.

## Funny things I’ve noticed about New England

  1. The Red Sox are Gods.
  2. Dunkin Donuts is no joke for New Englanders.
  3. New Englanders are infamous for being unfriendly on the surface, but they’re great if you strike up a conversation. They love being tough.
  4. California is seen as a magical, amazing place.
  5. Winter is coming, always.

I’m excited most of all to be in Boston because of the proximity to great front-end developers and open-source enthusiasts. Major players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are here, along with smaller shops like Bocoup. I look forward to more amazing things and traveling along the East Coast to see the beautiful, major American cities. Follow me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/antgnz) to see my photos.

I’ll be writing more often now that I’m settled. Cheers to new adventures!
