I've decided to focus my first reading list post around cutting back from Big
Tech&copy;. I think since the 2016 US Election and Cambridge Analytica scandal,
we've all realized how social media and technology companies sell information
about you to sell power and influence. More recently, social media has allowed
rumors and conspiracy theories about vaccine efficacy to run wild. I've
reflected on my use of technology and found posts written by people who not only
feel that there is something fundamentally broken but have started implementing
solutions to change their relationship with their tools.

I'm detoxing from social media, considering how services degrade my
privacy and purchasing tools that insist on privacy.  Here's what I've done so
far:

* Downloaded my media from social media accounts
* Deleted Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook
* Removed all details from my
    [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonymgonzales/) to use it as a roledex
* Wrote my [resume as printable webpage](/resume.html)
* Switched to Firefox with ad blockers
* Stopped using Alexa in the home

There's more to do. I still use Big Tech&copy; for daily computing work, file
storage, running this blog, analytics, taking photos, emailing, calendars, etc.
I don't imagine I'll be completely off the grid soon but I'm pleased to be more
control of my information.
