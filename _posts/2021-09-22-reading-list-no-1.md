The first reading list post is about my relationship to Big Tech&copy;. I've
reflected on my use of technology and found posts written by people who not only
feel that there is something fundamentally broken but have started implementing
solutions to change their relationship with their tools.

I think since the 2016 US Election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, we've
all realized how social media and technology companies sell information about
you to sell power and influence. More recently, social media has allowed rumors
and conspiracy theories about vaccine efficacy to run wild. I'm detoxing from
social media, considering how these entertainment services degrade my privacy
and waste my time.

Here's what I've done so far:

* Downloaded my media from social media accounts
* Deleted Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook
* Removed all details from my
    [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonymgonzales/) to use it as a roledex
* Wrote my [resume as printable webpage](/resume.html)
* Switched to Firefox with ad blockers
* Stopped using Alexa in the home

There's more to do. I still use Big Tech&copy; for daily computing work, file
storage, running this blog, analytics, taking photos, emailing, calendars, etc.
I don't imagine I'll be off the grid soon, but I'm pleased to be in control of
my information.
