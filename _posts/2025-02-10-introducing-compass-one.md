I'm proud to have served as the Frontend Engineering Lead for [Compass
One](https://one.compass.com){:target="_blank"}, the first-ever real estate client dashboard! This
project has been years in the making and combines some of the largest products
on the platform into an industry first.

I had the honor of attending the New York Stock Exchange opening bell ceremony
on February 5, 2025, to celebrate the launch. Standing on the historic NYSE
trading floor alongside my colleagues as the bell rang was an unforgettable
culmination of our team's hard work and success.
