I'm thrilled to share that Compass One has been recognized with the [Inman
Innovators 2025
Award](https://web.archive.org/web/20250808132533/https://www.inman.com/inman-innovator-awards/)
for Most Innovative Client Experience Solution!

This recognition from Inman validates what our team set out to buildâ€”the
industry's first all-in-one client dashboard providing 24/7 transparency into
real estate transactions. As the Frontend Engineering Lead, I'm incredibly
proud of what the team has accomplished.

## Impact

By Q2 2025, agents chose to use Compass One with 116,000 clients. This
contributed to Compass achieving record quarterly results with a 6.09% market
share and the platform hitting an all-time high of 24 average weekly sessions
per agent.
