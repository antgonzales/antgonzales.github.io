Hi, I’m Anthony Gonzales — a Software Engineer and tech team leader with a
passion for web development and innovative user experiences. Based in New York
City, I bring over 7 years of experience in the tech industry, where I've led
pivotal projects at companies like
[Compass](https://www.compass.com/){:target="_blank"} and
[Glossier](https://www.glossier.com){:target="_blank"}, as well as provided
expert consulting for clients such as [Benefit
Cosmetics](https://www.benefitcosmetics.com){:target="_blank"} and Mint.com.

Throughout my career, I have successfully managed teams and projects of
different scales, from building Glossier's e-commerce platform from scratch to
driving Compass's high-adoption Search and CRM initiatives. This journey has
given me extensive exposure to a range of project types, team dynamics, and
business challenges, equipping me with a versatile skill set and a deep
understanding of both client needs and market trends.

I specialize in web technologies like Typescript, Node.js, React, and Postgres.
I'm also an expert in Test Driven Development methodologies.

For more insights into my work or to discuss potential collaborations, feel
free to [contact me](/contact).
