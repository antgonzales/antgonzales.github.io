Hi, I’m Anthony Gonzales — a Software Engineer and tech team leader with a
passion for web development and innovative user experiences. Based in New York
City, I bring over 7 years of experience in the tech industry, where I've led
pivotal projects at companies like
[Compass](https://www.compass.com/){:target="_blank"} and
[Glossier](https://www.glossier.com){:target="_blank"}, as well as provided
expert consulting for clients such as [Benefit
Cosmetics](https://www.benefitcosmetics.com){:target="_blank"} and Mint.com.

Throughout my career, I have successfully managed teams and projects of
different scales, from building Glossier's e-commerce platform from scratch to
driving Compass's high-adoption Search and CRM initiatives. This journey has
given me extensive exposure to a range of project types, team dynamics, and
business challenges, equipping me with a versatile skill set and a deep
understanding of both client needs and market trends.

My expertise lies in creating seamless, engaging digital experiences. I excel
in Agile environments, where I blend my technical knowledge with a strong
entrepreneurial mindset to deliver solutions that not only meet but exceed
business objectives.

For more insights into my work or to discuss potential collaborations, feel
free to [contact me](/contact).
